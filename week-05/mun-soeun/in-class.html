It is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was constructed to celebrate Rhodes\' victory over the ruler of Cyprus, Antigonus I Monophthalmus, whose son unsuccessfully besieged Rhodes in 305 BC. Before its destruction in the earthquake of 226 BC, the Colossus of Rhodes stood over 30 meters (98 feet) high,[1] making it one of the tallest statues of the ancient world.[2]</p>',

There are no extant Babylonian texts which mention the gardens, and no definitive archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon.</p>',
